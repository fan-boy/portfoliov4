Project Name: Dune Security
Project Title: Adaptive Cyber Risk Management Platform

Overview:Recognizing that 90% of cybersecurity breaches stem from human error, Dune Security set out to build a user-adaptive risk management platform. The platform uses AI to dynamically assign training to employees, helping them identify spoofing and phishing threats and reduce organizational risk.

As Head of Product Design, I was responsible for maturing the platform’s visual identity and establishing a scalable design system to support future data visualizations and feature growth.

Problem Statement:How might we design a cybersecurity platform that adapts to user behavior, delivers personalized training, and provides clear, actionable insights to reduce human-driven risk?

Outcome:We delivered a robust, modern platform that:
	•	Visualizes organizational risk at every level
	•	Assigns dynamic, contextual training
	•	Supports role-based access and control
	•	Integrates with enterprise tools and APIs
	•	Scales with growing data and user needs

Role: Head of Product DesignTimeline: OngoingFocus Areas: Design system, data visualization, user experience, role-based access

Design System & Visualization Foundation

We built the Dune Security component system from the ground up to support:
	•	Data clarity: Emphasis on legibility and visual hierarchy
	•	Modern aesthetics: Clean, intuitive UI for security professionals
	•	Scalability: Designed to accommodate new data types and visualizations

Key Features

1. Organization-Wide Risk Visibility
	•	Dashboards show cumulative risk scores, individual risk factors, and actions that impact risk.
	•	Data is pulled from integrations like Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, Google Workspace, Abnormal, Proofpoint, and Mindcast.

2. Role-Based Access & Custom Views
	•	From CEOs to contract workers, users see only the data relevant to their role.
	•	CISOs have full access to configure, monitor, and manage the platform.

3. Dynamic, Contextual Training
	•	AI-driven training is assigned based on user behavior and risk level.
	•	Employees can view their personal risk score, past phishing simulations, and training history.

4. CISO Control Panel
	•	CISOs can:
	▫	Assign training by risk level
	▫	Access a library of cybersecurity and compliance topics
	▫	Monitor training sessions with video playback and knowledge checks

5. Admin Configuration Tools
	•	Intuitive interface for managing:
	▫	Permissions
	▫	Notification preferences
	▫	System configurations

Impact & Recognition
	•	Trusted by CISOs at Warner Music Group, Hugo Boss, and Netlify
	•	Secured $2 million in funding
	•	Positioned to transform how organizations manage human-driven cybersecurity risk

Summary:At Dune Security, I led the design of a platform that empowers organizations to proactively manage cyber risk through adaptive training, clear data visualization, and scalable design. The result is a tool trusted by top security leaders and built to evolve with the needs of modern enterprises.
