Project Name: University Park
Project Title: University Park Sustainability Platform

Overview:A digital platform designed to educate residents of University Park on sustainable practices and foster a community around sustainability. Built in collaboration with the University Park Sustainability Committee, the platform promotes engagement, education, and action through gamification and community features.

Problem Statement:How might we effectively encourage University Park residents to adopt and maintain sustainable living practices in their homes and daily lives, while fostering community engagement and collaboration?

Outcome:We designed a multifaceted platform that includes:
	•	Educational resources
	•	A list of actionable sustainability practices
	•	Gamification elements (badges, points, challenges)
	•	Administrative tools for the Sustainability Committee

Research & Discovery

1. Market ResearchWe began with a top-down approach, exploring global sustainability initiatives and narrowing our focus to the needs of University Park residents.

2. Expert InterviewsWe spoke with subject matter experts and members of the neighboring Tacoma Park sustainability committee to gather insights and inspiration.

Understanding the Users

Residents of University Park
	•	Use the platform to assess sustainability practices
	•	Learn about environmental impact and conservation
	•	Engage with the community and track progress

Green Team (Sustainability Committee)
	•	Use the platform to collect data and analyze metrics
	•	Update content and manage resident engagement
	•	Make informed decisions based on platform usage

Information Architecture

We conducted card sorting exercises (online and in-person) with residents and proxy users to define the structure of the “Practices” page and overall navigation.

Design Process

Low-Fidelity Sketches & Crazy EightsEach team member sketched ideas independently. We voted on the best features and layouts to move forward.

Mid-Fidelity WireframesWe created user flows and mid-fi wireframes to test interactions and layout with users.

Motivators & Engagement Features

1. GamificationResidents earn points and badges for completing sustainable actions.

2. Physical RewardsIdeas included plaques for front yards and town-branded merchandise.

3. Continuous EngagementThe platform supports ongoing events and challenges to keep residents involved.

4. Community ForumA space for residents to share progress, ask questions, and support each other.

Design System

With five designers on the team, we created a shared moodboard and voted on a unified visual theme. This helped us build a consistent and scalable design system.

User Testing & Iteration

We tested the platform with 7 residents. Key feedback:
	•	Unclear Purpose: Users didn’t understand the app’s goal or how to earn points.
	•	Confusing IA: Overlap between categories like “Habitat and Biodiversity” and “Garden Management.”
	•	Profile Page: Needed better organization to show progress and achievements.
	•	Mixed Reactions to Gamification: Some users felt it was too playful.
	•	Points System: Confusion around how points and badges were awarded.

Changes Made:
	•	Added an “Our Mission” section and improved onboarding
	•	Refined the Practices IA
	•	Simplified visual design and content layout

Final Designs

High-fidelity screens were created and handed off for development. The prototype includes:
	•	Resident onboarding
	•	Practice tracking
	•	Community forum
	•	Admin dashboard

Admin Experience

The admin dashboard provides:
	•	High-level usage insights
	•	Household-level activity tracking
	•	WYSIWYG editing tools for non-technical users

Key Learnings

1. Balancing Gamification and SeriousnessToo much gamification felt gimmicky. We learned to balance fun with meaningful environmental impact.

2. Clarity in CommunicationClear onboarding and in-app messaging are essential to help users understand the platform’s purpose and how to engage with it.

Summary:This project taught me how to design for civic engagement, balance multiple user needs, and create a platform that drives real-world behavior change through thoughtful UX and community-building features.
