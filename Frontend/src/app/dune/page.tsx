                <h4 className="text-fontprimary ">
                  As the sole product designer, I led a ground-up redesign of Dune Security’s platform—transforming fragmented, complex security data into actionable, user-centric workflows. My work not only improved the product experience but also drove strategic shifts in how the company positioned, sold, and scaled the platform.

                <p className="mb-4 text-fontsecondary leading-relaxed t">
                  Security awareness training was failing to keep pace with AI-powered threats. CISOs and security teams were overwhelmed by fragmented data (IAM, EDR, DLP, SEG) and lacked actionable insights to reduce human-driven cyber risk. Existing tools felt like static report cards, not dynamic control centers for prevention and action.

                I co-created the product roadmap with the CEO and CTO, using a RICE scoring model to prioritize features that balanced user impact and engineering effort. For example, we launched the adaptive training module before advanced analytics, as user interviews revealed immediate pain around manual interventions. This accelerated customer value and improved our sales narrative.

              <p className="mb-4 text-fontsecondary leading-relaxed ">
                I also worked closely with the GTM team, translating user research into sales enablement materials and product messaging. The new risk score visualization became a core part of our sales pitch, helping the GTM team clearly articulate ROI to prospects and close deals more effectively.
